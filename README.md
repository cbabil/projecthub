# ProjectHub

ProjectHub is a desktop app that helps you create and manage projects locally.

## Get the App
- Download the latest release for your OS from GitHub Releases.
- Windows: run the installer `.exe`.
- macOS: open the `.dmg` and drag ProjectHub to Applications.
- Linux: run the `.AppImage` (make it executable if needed).

On first launch, ProjectHub sets up its data folder at `~/.projecthub`.

## Use ProjectHub
- Add your own templates and libraries into the data folder (they appear in the app automatically).
- Click **New Project**, choose templates and libraries, review, and create.
- ProjectHub saves the project entry and scaffolds the files/folders to your chosen destination.
